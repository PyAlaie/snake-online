# Snake Online

## Introduction

The snake game is probably one of the most classic video games in the world. The goal of this project is to create an online platform to play this game with your friends. This game is written in pure python with socket-programming and multithreading.

## How To Run

1. In order to play this game you need to launch `server.py` which runs the server on port 3141.

2. Then each client should run `client.py` file in order to connect to the server. The game will start when four players join the server.

Note that all the clients and server should be in the same local network. If a client wants to join to a server outside the network, it should change the IP address in `client.py` file to the server address.

## Go Beyond

This project is an attempt to create an online snake game and there are lots of features that could be added to the project. Feel free to contribute and play with the code to add new creative features you find interesting. Have Fun!
